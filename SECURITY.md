# Security Guidelines for CyberShield Project

## üîí Environment Variables Security

### ‚úÖ Current Security Measures

The project has been configured with the following security best practices:

1. **No Hardcoded Secrets**: All sensitive values are loaded from environment variables
2. **Template File**: `.env.example` contains only placeholder values, not real credentials
3. **Git Ignore**: `.env` files are properly excluded from version control
4. **Secure Defaults**: Development and production configurations are separated

### üö® Critical Security Checklist

Before deploying this application, ensure you have:

- [ ] **Replaced all placeholder values** in your `.env` file with real credentials
- [ ] **Generated a strong SESSION_SECRET** (32+ characters, random)
- [ ] **Created unique GitHub OAuth credentials** for your application
- [ ] **Set up a dedicated MongoDB database** with proper access controls
- [ ] **Used a secure ADMIN_PASSWORD** (not "your-admin-password")
- [ ] **Never committed** your `.env` file to version control
- [ ] **Set different credentials** for development and production environments

### üîê Credential Security Requirements

#### Session Secret
```bash
# Generate a secure session secret
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
```

#### GitHub OAuth Setup
1. Go to [GitHub Developer Settings](https://github.com/settings/applications/new)
2. Create a new OAuth App with these settings:
   - **Application name**: Your app name
   - **Homepage URL**: Your domain (e.g., `https://yourdomain.com`)
   - **Authorization callback URL**: `https://yourdomain.com/auth/github/callback`
3. Copy the Client ID and Client Secret to your `.env` file
4. **Never share** these credentials publicly

#### MongoDB Security
1. Create a dedicated database user with minimal required permissions
2. Use a strong, unique password
3. Enable IP whitelisting in MongoDB Atlas
4. Use connection string with SSL enabled
5. Regularly rotate database credentials

#### Admin Password
- Use a password manager to generate a strong password
- Include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters
- Minimum 12 characters recommended
- Never use default or common passwords

### üõ°Ô∏è Additional Security Recommendations

#### 1. Environment-Specific Configurations
- Use different databases for development, staging, and production
- Implement different OAuth apps for each environment
- Use environment-specific session secrets

#### 2. Monitoring and Logging
- Monitor failed login attempts
- Log security-related events
- Set up alerts for suspicious activities
- Regularly review access logs

#### 3. Regular Security Maintenance
- Rotate secrets quarterly
- Update dependencies regularly (`npm audit`)
- Review and update OAuth app settings
- Monitor MongoDB access patterns

#### 4. Production Deployment Security
- Use HTTPS in production (enforce SSL)
- Set secure cookie settings for production
- Implement rate limiting for authentication endpoints
- Use a reverse proxy (nginx, cloudflare) for additional security

### üö® What NOT to Do

‚ùå **Never commit secrets to version control**
‚ùå **Don't use default passwords in production**
‚ùå **Don't share credentials via email or chat**
‚ùå **Don't use the same credentials across environments**
‚ùå **Don't store secrets in frontend code**
‚ùå **Don't use weak session secrets**

### üìû Security Incident Response

If you suspect your credentials have been compromised:

1. **Immediately rotate** all affected credentials
2. **Revoke** old OAuth tokens
3. **Change** database passwords
4. **Review** access logs for unauthorized activity
5. **Update** all deployed environments
6. **Monitor** for unusual activity

### üîç Security Validation

Use these commands to validate your security setup:

```bash
# Check that .env is not tracked by git
git check-ignore .env

# Verify no secrets in tracked files
grep -r "your-github-oauth\|your-unique-session\|username:password" --exclude-dir=node_modules .

# Check for weak passwords (adjust pattern as needed)
grep -E "(password|secret|key).*=.*(123|admin|test|default)" .env
```

**Remember**: Security is an ongoing process, not a one-time setup. Regularly review and update your security measures.
